# Rust Roma talks
Repository used to propose and request talks or other activities for [Rust Rome meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Roma/).


## Proposing a talk

Got an idea for a talk? Raise an [issue](https://github.com/RustRome/talks/issues) with the details, and we'll work with you from there.

Talks can be anywhere from 5 mins onwards, so don't feel like you need a lot of content in order to talk (if you have more than 30-40 mins, it'd be best to split your content into several talks). We are also happy to review your talk if you'd like that.

## Requesting a talk

Would you like to see a talk on a particular topic? Something you'd like to understand better, or an interesting area?

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/RustRome/talks/issues) with the details and label it with `request`, and we'll see if we can organise someone to give that talk :)
